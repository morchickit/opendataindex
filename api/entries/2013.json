All data can be consulted and downloaded (in xls) free of charge according to the terms and conditions stated in the site (T\u00e9rminos y Condiciones de uso de la informaci\u00f3n) allowing the user to create its own time series and receive the data in different ways, for example in millions, accumulative or percentage of the GDP.\n\nAdditional Comments from consulted civil society specialists - 10/11/2013\nAn initial revision with civil society specialists was done in november 2013. Specialists were not certain that all expenses can be found in a detailed monthly basis. Nonetheless, a more detailed research and comparison with other countries should be done for 2014 census."}, {"place": "mt", "dataset": "spending", "year": "2013", "rank": "11", "score": "60", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Yes", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www.nso.gov.mt/statdoc/document_view.aspx?id=3631&backurl=/themes/theme_page.aspx", "format": "Excel", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": "2013", "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-10-23T15:15:59", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": "Malta's national statistics office provides information related to the economic and financial status of the country.

Furthermore, there are no official statements to acknowledge any intentions of making the National Map open data.

ANCPI offered to give us the requested dataset, but at the price established through the Order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs no. 39/2009, which for the entire Romanian territory, is about 800.000 EURO.Today, the dataset containing the boundaries of the Romanian municipalities is the only dataset available through a visualization service compliant with INSPIRE on the geoportal maintained by ANCPI.

Special comment from Ivan Pavlov: we consider the Russian legislation as open licensed, taking into the account Russian Legislation provisions. Russia has no special license for government data and we should consider the legal regime of data use and dissemination form \"the common rule\" point of view. According to the Civil \u0421ode of Russia (Article 1259), official government documents including laws, other legal texts, judicial decisions, other materials of legislative, administrative and judicial character are not objects of copyright. According to the Russian FOI law (Article 4), one of the main FOI principles in Russia is the freedom to seek, receive, transmit and disseminate information on activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government in any legal way. Also according to the Russian FOI law (Article 1), information about the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government is information (including documentation), established within government bodies, their territorial bodies, local authorities or institutions subordinate to the state authorities, local self-government (hereinafter - organizations subordinated to it), or received by the mentioned bodies and organizations. Information on the activities of government bodies and bodies of local self-government also includes laws and other normative legal acts concerning information on the activities of bodies of local self-government \u2013 municipal legal acts defining structure, competence, formation and operating procedures of the above-specified bodies and organizations, and other information concerning their activity. Thus, according to the current Russian legislation, there are no legal restrictions on use, reuse or redistribute legislation data."}, {"place": "bm", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www.bermudalaws.bm/default.aspx", "format": "PDF", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-10-09T14:23:59", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": ""}, {"place": "pt", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://dre.pt/index.html", "format": "PDF", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": "1910", "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-10-04T08:23:06", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": ""}, {"place": "sn", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www.jo.gouv.sn/", "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-05-17T14:51:15", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": "Only a small part is available in digital format."}, {"place": "lt", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "Unsure", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www3.lrs.lt/dokpaieska/forma_l.htm", "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-02-23T11:38:00", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": "The legislation is available, however, mostly in .doc format"}, {"place": "se", "dataset": "legislation", "year": "2013", "rank": "26", "score": "45", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Unsure", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "No", "url": "http://62.95.69.15/sfs/sfst_form2.html", "format": "txt", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2013-02-21T18:04:32", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "anonymous", "reviewcomments": null, "details": "Unstructured text data for now.

Russian government delegates ecological issues and pollution monitoring to regional level of the executive government branch. But regional government rarely publish pollution monitoring information and pollution sources. I know only a few public data sources available like Mosecomonitoring (Moscow ecological survey). But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only \"images\" and \"graphics\". So availability of pollutants data for Russian Federation is about 80% - for \"No\", and only about 20% for \"yes\". The only available sources: - http://dynamic.igce.ru/ (not up to date) - pollution monitoring and radiation monitoring (by Rosatom) - http://www.russianatom.ru/ I suggest this dataset for following review. \n\n\nStep by step explanation\n1. Does the data exist?   \nYes, here it is http://www.mnr.gov.ru/upload/iblock/96e/gosdoklad%2020_07_2013.pdf as report and a few other sources available.\n\n2. Is data in digital form?   \nYes, data available via website(-s)\n\n3. Publicly available?   \nYes, this data is publicly available. We don't need FOI request to get it.\n\n4. Is the data available for free?   \nYes, this data is available for free. No payment is required.\n\n5. Is the data available online?   \nYes. Data available at http://pass.rzd.ru\n\n6. Is the data machine readable?   \nNo, it's not machine readable. Only HTML and PDF files\n\n7. Available in bulk?   \nNo, data is not in bulk\n\n8. Openly licensed?   \nNo, this data is public domain data but no open license available.\n\n9. Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis?\nNo, data is not published timely.
