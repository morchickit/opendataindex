These payments requests collectively are known as the Payments Information Repository, or PIR. Treasury promised in 2012 testimony to the Senate that it would publish the PIR as open data, but has not fulfilled the promise (and the DATA Act doesn't require it to).\n\nDetails on Treasury's PIR promise are here: http://datacoalition.blogspot.com/2012/07/senate-hearing-illuminates-need-for.html\n\nBecky Sweger - National priorities project\nAfter a GAO audit (http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-476) of USASpending.gov was published this summer, HHS agreed to start submitting aggregated Medicare spending data. I can confirm that Medicare benefits payments are showing up now (they didn't as of a few months ago), but didn't confirm the data are complete.\nIf Medicare benefits are now represented in USASpending.gov, it's likely no longer true that the site represents \"only a small part of federal spending data.\" I'd re-reword to \"So while the data are available, they represent an incomplete picture of federal spending that does not include government salaries, benefits, and other operating expenditures.\"\nAgency procedures for reporting money paid to (or on behalf of) individuals are inconsistent. The Social Security Administration has always done a great job of reporting. HHS finally decided to aggregate and report Medicare. USDA, however, doesn't accurately report food stamp benefits in USASpending.gov. Since this type of payment represents the largest chunk of U.S. spending, it's important to have consistent and enforced guidelines for reporting.\n\n\n2013 comments: The data at USASpending.gov accounts for only a fraction of all government spending, and it is organized in a way that makes it hard to understand and use. So while the data are available, it's only a small part of federal spending data. It does not include expenses on government salaries and operating expenditures or information on Medicare, the nation's government sponsored medical insurance for the elderly (~20% of total spending). There are no government-wide spending records that would actually be more helpful --- that is, the government doesn't collect the type of data about its own spending that would be useful to the open government world. \n\nThe data available at USAspending.gov comes from a variety of sources and is presumably licensed based on the original source licenses: http://usaspending.gov/learn?tab=Sources%20of%20Data"}, {"place": "md", "dataset": "spending", "year": "2014", "rank": "15", "score": "10", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "No", "online": "No", "free": "No", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "No", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2014-11-30T16:01:57", "submitters": "Tryggvi Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "reviewers": "Daniela Mattern", "reviewcomments": "Expert review accepted", "details": "There is aggregated data for spending data, but not not on a monthly basis or per transaction."}, {"place": "tw", "dataset": "spending", "year": "2014", "rank": "15", "score": "10", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "No", "online": "No", "free": "No", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "No", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2014-11-30T15:59:53", "submitters": "Tryggvi Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "reviewers": "Mor Rubinstein", "reviewcomments": "Data is not transactional, but aggregated.

The file at www.postdanmark.dk contains postcodes and town/commune names, without geolocations in lat/long or equivalent. The link is to an inventory of maps, in shape files: how would these be used to obtain a table of postcodes and their lat/long please? Answer: The postcode information is available in multiple formats for different purposes. For polygons on maps (incl. lat/long), see here http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/Hvilke+data+er+omfattet/Hvilke+data+er+frie/Landinddelinger/DAGI/DAGI-download.htm and here http://www.adresse-info.dk/Default.aspx?tabid=220 (text in Danish, maps in shape, mapinfo and geomedia). There's also a webservice from which you can enter an address and obtain the postcode. I'm not an expert in geodata myself so in order to answer the postcode-related questions at the Census I had help from https://twitter.com/neogeografen (who might be more helpful in order to explain how to find the data of your need).

Thus, over time this database gets out of date versus the authoritative  data held by the USPS. Given this, the data is marked as not timely.\n\nIn addition, the ZCTA isn\u2019t as complete as the USPS zip-code list as it focused on geographical areas and so its coverage of e.g. PO boxes is more limited. However, given the specifications of this dataset this should not be considered a major limitation and so we have not docked points anywhere else.\n\n### More on Zip-Codes and the USPS\n\nThe full database of zip codes from the USPS has not yet been found although it looks like products are available for sale, and they are multiple datasets that can help to provide a whole picture.\n\nThe ZCTA file produced by the US Census Bureau is useful but is not the full USPS Database of Zip Codes and lookup tables. Instead, this is a census related product produced every 10 years.\n\n \"You may have noticed that Census Bureau products refer to \u201cZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs)\u201d and not simply to ZIP Codes\u2122. The reason that we cannot tabulate data for ZIP Codes is that they do not have distinct geographic boundaries. Designed by the U.S. Postal Service for use in mail delivery, ZIP Codes represent carrier routes made up of individual addresses. A true representation of ZIP Codes would separate out individual housing units and releasing data for them would risk disclosing personally identifiable information\". https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=10488\n\nThe ZCTAs are not the same as the (regularly updated) USPS postal code lookup files or the postal code database with addresses and Lat Long.

The data on legislation.gov.uk has been collated over a number of years from a variety of sources and is not all in the same base format.

Departmental level budgets are in a number of places, but the two collections available regularly free of charge under the UK Open Government Licence are: (1) the annual \"Estimates\" published each April for the financial year commencing that April. These are published in PDF format department by department and are at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmt-main-estimates for the last three years 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 The dataset for this fiscal year is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/main-supply-estimates-2014-to-2015. This dataset is \"up to date\" (2) the same, and some more detailed, data is contained in the \"Plans\" part of the COINS/OSCAR dataset http://data.gov.uk/dataset/coins (this also contains matching expenditure information). Although the expenditure information is published quarterly, the \"plans\" are not currently published in OSCAR data until the end of the financial year to which they relate. Once Plans information is available on OSCAR it is available for bulk download in machine readable format (CSV). In assessing the ratings fairly it was necessary to choose between the \"Estimates\" and \"OSCAR\" versions - the OSCAR version seemed closer to the ideal, even though it was not as up to date, and that is assessed here. - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oscar-annual-data-october-2014"}, {"place": "hk", "dataset": "budget", "year": "2014", "rank": "19", "score": "85", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "Yes", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www.budget.gov.hk/2013/index.html", "format": null, "licenseurl": "http://www.budget.gov.hk/2013/eng/important.html", "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": "SCMP", "timestamp": "2014-11-26T14:53:17", "submitters": "Pierre Chrzanowski", "reviewers": "Mor Rubinstein", "reviewcomments": "Change to non machine readable, data is in PDF.", "details": "The data are provided in pdf format by the Information Services Department (ISD) and Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government of the People's Republic of China.
