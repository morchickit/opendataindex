So, the 5-days forecast of temperature updated daily for districts only.\r\n 2. Generally, there are summaries provided on strong winds and rough seas (http://www.met.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4963). There are no 5-days forecast of wind updated daily.\r\n 3.

The file at www.postdanmark.dk contains postcodes and town/commune names, without geolocations in lat/long or equivalent. The link is to an inventory of maps, in shape files: how would these be used to obtain a table of postcodes and their lat/long please? Answer: The postcode information is available in multiple formats for different purposes. For polygons on maps (incl. lat/long), see here http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/Hvilke+data+er+omfattet/Hvilke+data+er+frie/Landinddelinger/DAGI/DAGI-download.htm and here http://www.adresse-info.dk/Default.aspx?tabid=220 (text in Danish, maps in shape, mapinfo and geomedia). There's also a webservice from which you can enter an address and obtain the postcode. I'm not an expert in geodata myself so in order to answer the postcode-related questions at the Census I had help from https://twitter.com/neogeografen (who might be more helpful in order to explain how to find the data of your need).

Thus, over time this database gets out of date versus the authoritative  data held by the USPS. Given this, the data is marked as not timely.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the ZCTA isn\u2019t as complete as the USPS zip-code list as it focused on geographical areas and so its coverage of e.g. PO boxes is more limited. However, given the specifications of this dataset this should not be considered a major limitation and so we have not docked points anywhere else.\r\n\r\n### More on Zip-Codes and the USPS\r\n\r\nThe full database of zip codes from the USPS has not yet been found although it looks like products are available for sale, and they are multiple datasets that can help to provide a whole picture.\r\n\r\nThe ZCTA file produced by the US Census Bureau is useful but is not the full USPS Database of Zip Codes and lookup tables. Instead, this is a census related product produced every 10 years.\r\n\r\n \"You may have noticed that Census Bureau products refer to \u201cZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs)\u201d and not simply to ZIP Codes\u2122. The reason that we cannot tabulate data for ZIP Codes is that they do not have distinct geographic boundaries.

The latter is a restrictive proprietary license (http://adresse.data.gouv.fr/static/pdf/BAN%20Licence%20de%20repartage.pdf).

It exists in two versions of the base and the first one is the one that is taken into account in this submission (and not in the previous one). We believe this BAN ODBL version can be accepted as an official source because:\r\n- A link to the ODBL version of the BAN, distributed by OSM France, is provided on an official & governmental website: https://adresse.data.gouv.fr/download/ (second link at the bottom of the page) according to the terms of the official BAN convention signed between IGN, La Poste, Etalab and  OSM France http://openstreetmap.fr/f/Convention%20BAN%2015%20avril%202015%20SCAN%20SIGNE.pdf\r\n- the data have the same source than the second version mentionned in the previous comment and is formated at and by Etalab (Prime Minister office for open data and open gov) \r\n\r\nPREVIOUS COMMENT FROM REGARDS CITOYENS : \r\n\r\nThe previously registered \"Base officielle des codes postaux\" by La Poste <https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-officielle-des-codes-postaux/> does not match the new requirements as it only provides openly an association of zipcodes with ciies.\r\nSome cities have multiple zipcodes, so even by associating the data with the opened administrative borders database GEOFLA <http://professionnels.ign.fr/geofla>, we would not be able to get coordinates corresponding to zipcodes.\r\n\r\nAlthough another database could fulfill the requirements to a larger extant : the national address database BAN that gives coordinates for all addresses including their zipcodes.

The Data Selector http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector allows a custom table to be constructed and either viewed or sent to the requestor as a CSV file. However there is a limit on the extent of the query (one test-drive for the Census gave \"The selection you requested will return 1176 rows of data in 770 columns. This exceeds our limit of 256 columns.\"). This meets the Census requirement, apart from bulk download. In addition national estimates of annual *emissions* of 36 air pollutants from 1971-2011 are downloadable in CSV format under the Open Government Licence from http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/data-selector, but again this is in the form of a table-builder and it does not seem possible to download all the data in bulk. Further public environmental data for the UK is maintained by several public bodies (mainly the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, plus Defra and DECC). Broadly speaking, data on major sources of pollutants is readily available via Government websites and public mapping applications.

Russian government delegates ecological issues and pollution monitoring to regional level of the executive government branch.

But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only \"images\" and \"graphics\". So availability of pollutants data for Russian Federation is about 80% - for \"No\", and only about 20% for \"yes\".

Roshydromet operates a system for the prompt identification and investigation of dangerous ecotoxicological consequences of emergencies. A system of global baseline environmental monitoring is maintained in Russia, and six integrated monitoring stations are located in biosphere reserves. Air quality monitoring is undertaken by the Institute for Global Climate and Ecology, which prepares the annual Survey of the Pollution of the Natural Environment in the Russian Federation http://www.igce.comcor.ru; and the Russian Aerospace Agency (Rosaviakosmos), which developed a system for environmental monitoring in space http://www/rosaviakosmos.ru. Air pollution monitoring is carried out in more than 350 Russian cities. It covers all major industrial centres and almost all cities with a population of over 100,000. The system includes 1,200 stations for monitoring air pollution in cities and other settlements. Around 4 million samples are analysed annually for more than 20 air pollutants. According to long-term observations, in more than 75 percent of Russian cities maximum concentrations of air pollutants (dust, CO, NO2, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, phenol) exceed established limits. Thus air quality in most Russian cities does not comply with established sanitary and hygienic norms. - See more at: http://www.greenpackonline.org/english/environmental-components.php?id=01-06-07-04#sthash.2EJ4mckw.dpuf\r\n\r\nits seem the google map is not working  to see the monitor site\r\n\r\n\r\nalso the city of Moscow have Air Quality monitoring system\r\nhttp://www.mosecom.ru/air/air-today/"}, {"place": "cl", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "8", "score": "70", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Yes", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://www.mma.gob.cl/retc/1279/channel.html", "format": "XLS,CSV", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": "National Information System on Air Quality", "publisher": "Ministry of Environment", "timestamp": "2015-08-27T15:04:41", "submitters": "Diego Ignacio", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked", "details": "all type of Pollutant is been monitoring  except of VOCs"}, {"place": "pt", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "8", "score": "70", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Yes", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "http://qualar.apambiente.pt/index.php?page=1", "format": "XLS", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": "European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register", "publisher": "European Commission", "timestamp": "2015-09-20T22:38:20", "submitters": "Ricardo Lafuente", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked", "details": "all Pollutant are measured\r\ndata can be download with web interface in xls format\r\nVOCs = C6H6(Benzene)"}, {"place": "ie", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "8", "score": "70", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Yes", "public": "Yes", "online": "Yes", "free": "Yes", "machinereadable": "Yes", "bulk": "Yes", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "Yes", "url": "https://www.epa.ie/air/quality/data/", "format": "xlsx, JSON", "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": "Environmental Protection Agency", "timestamp": "2015-10-07T15:43:55", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked\r\nfrom i understand its look like open sorce data \r\nbut i see that note was send to To examine the issue\r\n\r\nhis data is open data and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).\r\n\r\nThis means you are free to: Share \u2014 copy and redistribute the data in any medium or format; Adapt \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the data for any purpose, even commercially.

Most files are accessible in: http://www.inecc.gob.mx/calaire-presentacion/546-calaire-indicadores The Ministry of Environment's porta contains similar information:\r\nhttp://app1.semarnat.gob.mx/dgeia/clave_2010/clave/indicadores/ibi_apps/ind_clave_05.html\r\nhttp://app1.semarnat.gob.mx/dgeia/clave_2010/clave/indicadores/ibi_apps/ind_clave_06.html\r\nhttp://app1.semarnat.gob.mx/dgeia/clave_2010/clave/indicadores/ibi_apps/ind_clave_08.html Also, data is also identified under research center's web sites, such as Mexico's National Autonomous University: http://www.atmosfera.unam.mx/procca/Ozono.php Furthermore, SEMARNAT's Pollution Transfer and Emissions registry (RETC) contains a national database of air, water, ground and underground contains record of pollution sources and environmental assessments.

It concluded that Doha had the 12th highest average levels of small and fine particles, known as PM2.5, which can penetrate the respiratory tract and increase the risk of respiratory infections, lung cancer, heart disease and stroke.\r\n\r\nAccording to the US Environment Protection Agency, these particles \u2013 which often cannot be seen with the naked eye \u2013 are made up of heavy metals and toxic organic compounds, and originate from vehicle exhaust, smelting plants and the burning of organic materials.\r\n\r\nLarger particles \u2013 PM10 \u2013 are mostly caused by dust and smoke. In this category, Doha ranked just outside the top 30.\r\n\r\nStandards\r\n\r\nWhile the ministry\u2019s recent report didn\u2019t benchmark Qatar against other countries, it showed that local air pollution levels frequently exceed the WHO\u2019s recommendations as well as Qatar\u2019s own targets, which are more lax than the international standards.\r\n\r\nFor example, Qatar\u2019s national air quality standards for PM10 are 150 ug/m3 for 24 hours average concentration and 50 ug/m3 for the annual average concentration.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, the WHO\u2019s standards for PM10 are 50 ug/m3 for the 24-hour average \u2013 one third of Qatar\u2019s target \u2013 and 20 ug/m3 for the annual average concentration, which is less than half of the national figure.\r\n\r\nThe MDPS report uses statistics from the Ministry of Environment, which measures air quality at three monitoring stations in Doha \u2013 at Qatar University, Aspire Zone and the M\u00f6venpick Hotel on the Corniche.\r\n\r\nLevels highest at QU\r\n\r\nAll three monitoring stations recorded pollution levels above the recommended national and global levels. However, concentration levels of the larger particulates (PM10) were highest at QU station in the north of Doha.

These guidelines have been derived from available scientific and human health data, and basically represent \"safe levels\" below which no adverse health effects have been observed. The MAAGs are generally comparable to the corresponding air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization and other countries. \r\n\r\nThe averaging time, which varies from 1 to 24 hours for the different air pollutants in MAAGs, represents the period of time over which measurements is monitored and reported for the assessment of human health impacts of specific air pollutants. As such, the air pollution indices are normally monitored and reported for the same averaging times as those employed for the air quality standards/guidelines. \r\n\r\nThe API values are reported for varying averaging time as follows: \r\n\r\na) PM10 and SO2 on 24-hour running averages.\r\nb) CO on 8-hour running averages.\r\nc) NO2 and O3 on 1-hour running averages.\r\n\r\nThe API for PM10 reflects specifically levels of particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micron pollution and it may not be linked directly to visibility factors, as visibility is often determined by results of semi-quantitative observations over relatively shorter time periods. \r\n\r\nThe API value reported for a given time period represents the highest API value among all the sub-APIs calculated during that particular time period. The predominant parameter contributing towards a particular API value is normally indicated alongside the API value. This approach is an effort to promote a uniform and comparable API system.

In order to accomplish this mission, the Agency must be able to evaluate the status of the atmosphere compared to clean air standards and historical informations. That's why the NAEP established since 1996 an Air Quality Monitoring Network (AQMN) composed by thirteen permanent monitoring stations, two mobiles laboratories and a data elaboration centre with the aim of characterizing human health exposure and public impacts of conventional pollutants. In Tunisia, that extends over 163900 km\u00b2 and includes 24 metropolitans towns, there are several permanent monitoring stations located in many towns like Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, Gab\u00e8s Tozeur, Kef. In this paper, some stations of Tunisia and its monitoring networks have been selected as representative sites of the investigated area. In Tunis, the selected monitoring stations were located in Traffic area (Bab Saadoun), in urban area (El Mourouj) and in a suburban area (Nahli). Each station is provided with automatic analyzers of O 3 , NOx, SO 2 , PM10, CO and with meteorological sensors such as temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction. Nitrogen oxides, NO and NO 2 , were analysed using the chemiluminescence method. The measurement of ozone is based on the capacity of such gases to absorb ultraviolet rays with opportune wavelengths, generated by built-in lamp. Carbon monoxide CO is analyzed infrared rays absorption (IR). The measurement of PM10 is based on the beta ray attenuation method while SO 2 is analysed using a fluorescence method. For all parameters, the data are collected by the monitoring network every hour. The data were validated according to this protocol: first, a preliminary validation was carried out by the software, which invalidated all the data occurred in calibration hours and the data identified as artifacts then a manual calibration was carried out by the operators, considering the relations among the parameters. This way it is possible to verify that eventual critical data are related to real pollution situations. Moreover, meteorological data (wind speed and direction) were used to investigate about the influence of natural events on high or low concentration situations"}, {"place": "bw", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "73", "score": "5", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Unsure", "public": "Unsure", "online": "Unsure", "free": "Unsure", "machinereadable": "Unsure", "bulk": "Unsure", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Unsure", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2015-09-27T23:33:10", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked", "details": "The Environment department does take care of pollutions level, yet it is unclear is there is any information regarding the subject on a national level. \r\nit seem the government have measurement of Air Pollution\r\nfrom data form APIAN for SO2,NOx, NO2, O3, carbon monoxide (CO),hydrocarbons (HCs)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sei-international.org/rapidc/pdfs/botswana.pdf"}, {"place": "ng", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "73", "score": "5", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Yes", "digital": "Unsure", "public": "Unsure", "online": "Unsure", "free": "Unsure", "machinereadable": "Unsure", "bulk": "Unsure", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Unsure", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2015-09-30T13:49:55", "submitters": "Oludotun Babayemi", "reviewers": "yar michl", "reviewcomments": "checked", "details": "it seem that National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency is making monitoring programme on Air Pollution\r\nhttp://www.nesrea.gov.ng/news/air-quality.php"}, {"place": "sy", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "79", "score": "0", "isopen": "No", "exists": "No", "digital": "No", "public": "No", "online": "No", "free": "No", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "No", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2015-11-18T10:22:02", "submitters": "Mor Rubinstein", "reviewers": "Mor Rubinstein", "reviewcomments": "There is no data about air quality in Syria.", "details": "The official website of ministry of environment (http://moen.gov.sy/)"}, {"place": "aw", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "79", "score": "0", "isopen": "No", "exists": "Unsure", "digital": "Unsure", "public": "Unsure", "online": "Unsure", "free": "Unsure", "machinereadable": "Unsure", "bulk": "Unsure", "openlicense": "Unsure", "uptodate": "Unsure", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2015-11-17T12:57:30", "submitters": "Mor Rubinstein", "reviewers": "Mor Rubinstein", "reviewcomments": "Could not find the data on the internet.", "details": "Could not find air quality data for Aruba"}, {"place": "eg", "dataset": "emissions", "year": "2015", "rank": "79", "score": "0", "isopen": "No", "exists": "No", "digital": "No", "public": "No", "online": "No", "free": "No", "machinereadable": "No", "bulk": "No", "openlicense": "No", "uptodate": "No", "url": null, "format": null, "licenseurl": null, "dateavailable": null, "officialtitle": null, "publisher": null, "timestamp": "2015-08-30T14:31:46", "submitters": "anonymous", "reviewers": "Mor Rubinstein", "reviewcomments": "Accept submission", "details": "The Egyptian Meteorological Authority (EMA) provides 5 days forecast (6 hours) for Air Pollution, as well as monthly reports for actual observations [http://nwp.gov.eg/index.php/air-pollution].
