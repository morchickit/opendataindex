Submission 2015-11-23:
- Changed publisher to the meteorological institute, in stead of yr.no, which re-use their data.
- Changed bulk-download from ""Unsure"" to ""Yes"".
- Changed link to data to point to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute's web page about open data. From that page, there's links to api.met.no and yr.no for weather forecasts and to other services for bulk-downloads and historical data.

Met Office provides a restricted API to the forecast data. [restrictions][2]  registration and used under [licence][3]. Data is provided in XML and JSON. Data is not available for bulk download.

HOWEVER the Cabinet Office provides an API to all of the data, with unlimited access: [API on Azure Marketplace][5]. The only requirement is that you register, which is reasonable when the Met Office data is about 20GB per day. Since there is no size restriction with this API, beyond technical constraints, you can easily download what you want, so that should be considered easy bulk access.

Some [historic data][4] is available for download but other historic data must be purchased.

Historic data is a bit problematic here, the Saudi Open Data Portal (http://data.gov.sa/) provides datasets for temperature (http://data.gov.sa/dataset/temperature), wind (http://data.gov.sa/dataset/wind), humidity (http://data.gov.sa/dataset/relative-humidity), thunderstorms (http://data.gov.sa/dataset/thunderstorms), fog (http://data.gov.sa/dataset/fog-phenomena), etc. However, when accessed the most recent XLS files, they are of 2013.

Note, although the data on the Open Data portal is in bulk and openly licensed, that on the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment is copyrighted, and since we gave more weight to the latter as the former is not up to date. We answered the questions about licensing and machine readability according to how the information is presented in the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment"

However, there are some loopholes found by follow the 4 criterias for this category:

 1. There are 3 types of weather forecast; general, states and districts. So, the 5-days forecast of temperature updated daily for districts only.
 2. Generally, there are summaries provided on strong winds and rough seas (http://www.met.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4963). There are no 5-days forecast of wind updated daily.
 3. Normally, there will be 5-days forecast of percipitation updated daily but this is only for states (http://www.met.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1304&Itemid=1749) and districts (http://www.met.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3406&Itemid=1930).
 4. Unfortunately, there are limited historical temperature data provided. What was found from MetMalaysia website is data from 2014 until 2015. Normally, data was visualized in 4 types of figures; Rainfall Map for Malaysia, Mean Monthly Temperature, Mean Monthly Maximum Temperature & Mean Monthly Minimum Temperature. (http://www.met.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=847&Itemid=1586)

In order for Malaysians or non-Malaysians to have access for complete data by follow these 4 criterias, the entrance fees may not required because there  is Freedom of Information (FOI) Act takes place in the Selangor state territory. Therefore, it is possible for people to submit FOI request to the person in change in order to have access for the data.

1. Water quality is a regional, not federal, matter. The global census prevents me to link to more than one source for the data, which is in this case hard to do. 

2. Lack of definition of the dataset. Is this about water surfaces? Of water ways or watercourses? Of also of lakes, the seashore, etc?
Or is it about ground water? Potable water, sewage water,...

Data is very dispersed. The Walloon region has a good tool to search the quality of potable water in your street, with levels of hardness and chemicals. Flanders also has a seperate webpage with data on swimming water quality. In lakes, swimming pools and the sea. 
They also have extensive reports and different datasets on water quality of measuring on the OpenDataForum. 

So although a lot is going on water quality data in our regional governments, there is no easy way of measuring this on a national scale."

However, non of the data sets on govdata.de published by the National Statistics Agency carry the NC component. Thereby the data is openly licensed. Furthermore the Datenlizenz 2.0 has been approved by the Open Definition Advisory Council recently and it can be assumed that it will replace the 1,0 version shortly to erase and ambiguities about openness."

Final reviewer: The majority of information is available as PDF embedded in a flash reader. The data overall is available in a non-readable format and is not available in bulk. Yet these criteria were marked as 'unsure' since one can filter and download quite some data through the CensusInfo database, incl. in a machine-readable format. 

Regarding the timeliness of data, it is marked as outdated: 
http://www.censusinfo.capmas.gov.eg/DivInfo/ and http://www.censusinfo.capmas.gov.eg/DivInfo/DIWizard/DIWizardHome.aspx are the CAPMAS database; they seem to provided data from either 1980 or 2012 (unclear). Indeed, some summary numbers are provided for 2014 (e.g., http://www.capmas.gov.eg/Pepo/lab_e.pdf). Lastly, it is unknown what the release mechanism is and how often the data is updated.

The review team would like to add that we use secondary data in order to assess our data. This secondary data actually made the criteria more accurate and brought the score of more countries up. For other comments, see our insights page.","http://www.transparenciapresupuestaria.gob.mx is a very nice website detailing government spending.

Comments to the reviewer and OD Index: 
Neither the International Monetary Funds’ (IMF) Fiscal Transparency Code of 2014 nor the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Council on Budgetary Governance Recommendations of 2015 make reference to transactional information (including individual transaction records) as a relevant aggregate but, in terms of openness, stress particularly on coverage, comparability, fullness and relevance, establishing clear and homogenous expenditures classifications. 

Therefore, it is important to mention that the Open Budget Survey, conducted by the International Budget Partnership does not contemplate transactional information as part of the neither the survey. Nevertheless, it does include the transparency of disaggregated information by line item according to the established recognized classifications.

In accordance to the above-mentioned and globally recognized best practices on fiscal transparency, the Mexican fiscal transparency portal: www.transparenciapresupuestaria.gob.mx does provide for substantial and open spending information, as acknowledged by the International Budget Partnership in their Open Budget Index score for 2015 in open formats.

Finally, it is noteworthy that 2014 and 2015 index, according to the website, has the same parameters of evaluating this variable, nonetheless the evaluation with same (and even more) information published from year to year has brought the assessment down. Therefore, for it to be a comparable and functional index, it should disclose the methodology changes that generate this downgrade."

We emphasis that this measurement looks only at data openness, and there is still work to be done about the quality and the completeness of the data.","Procurements data (both tenders and awarded contracts) is available as open data. However there are challenges with the data:

- Tenders data fit nearly perfectly since recently the requirements, regularily published by DILA as the BOAMP database under the Open Licence as lots of [XML files][1]. The bulk criteria does not apply to this dataset.

- Awards data only provides procurement from a portion of the central governmental entities (see [here][2] and [here][3]), estimated to represent only 40 to 60% of the global amount awarded each year. This dataset is only updated yearly and has been published on an irregular basis and inconsistent formats for the last four years making the bulk criteria not applicable to the French dataset.

The dataset on [2014 procurement tenders][4] is an extract of PLACE, the national procurement marketplace. It includes tenders name, description of the tenders and status of the buying unit, supplier name, award title, date of the notification (DAY/MONTH) city, zip code, value of the award, description of the award, if it was attributed to an SME. 

[Data from 2011, 2012, 2013][5]

Data on procurement tenders by some sub-national entities (city, departments, regions) and independant administrative authorities are generally not present on data.gouv.fr but there are some, such as [CNIL][6] and the [City of Poitiers][7].

From this dataset you need to combine several subsets to get to a full postcode list: The ‘NUM’ files give you address index numbers, its georeferences, the house number and the postcode, and a number that corresponds with a street. The ‘OPR’ files give you the corresponding street name, and the number of the place it is in. The ‘WPL’ files give you the place name, and through a separate table also the municipality it is in.

Open postcode data which meets the specification here (postcodes and corresponding geospatial locations - lat/long or equivalent) is available via the Ordnance Survey's Code-Point Open dataset, which contains the 1.4m GB post codes each with a UK national grid reference of the postcode's location in eastings and northings (convertable to lat/long by published formulae) and with the administrative area (country/county/district/ward, plus National Health Service Region and Authority) in which it is located. This is updated quarterly. Similar Postcode data for the devolved province of Northern Ireland is *not* available as Open Data. The main UK *address* database (~24m individual addresses) is confusing called the Postcode Address File. This is a subscription-only database privately owned by the Royal Mail. The Open Data User Group have been pressing for its release too - see http://data.gov.uk/blog/dont-sell-our-postcodes-odug-on-why-we-should-have-open-addressing-in-the-uk 
The Postcode data as of August 2014 is available here: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/Docs/PostCodes/ONSPD_AUG_2014_csv.zip

Postal codes can also be found at: http://www.postdanmark.dk/da/Privat/Kundeservice/postnummerkort/Sider/home.aspx QA question: Please explain how to obtain the data required for this item of the census according to the definition above. The file at www.postdanmark.dk contains postcodes and town/commune names, without geolocations in lat/long or equivalent. The link is to an inventory of maps, in shape files: how would these be used to obtain a table of postcodes and their lat/long please? Answer: The postcode information is available in multiple formats for different purposes. For polygons on maps (incl. lat/long), see here http://www.gst.dk/Emner/Frie_data/Hvilke+data+er+omfattet/Hvilke+data+er+frie/Landinddelinger/DAGI/DAGI-download.htm and here http://www.adresse-info.dk/Default.aspx?tabid=220 (text in Danish, maps in shape, mapinfo and geomedia). There's also a webservice from which you can enter an address and obtain the postcode. I'm not an expert in geodata myself so in order to answer the postcode-related questions at the Census I had help from https://twitter.com/neogeografen (who might be more helpful in order to explain how to find the data of your need).

The US Census provide zip-code centroids as part of their 2010 Gazetteer located at http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer2010.html in the form of the Zip-Code Tabulation Areas:

http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/Gaz_zcta_national.zip

This data is open data (openly licensed, and machine readable etc).

However, there are some limitations of this data as it is based off the census, the last of which was in 2010. Thus, over time this database gets out of date versus the authoritative  data held by the USPS. Given this, the data is marked as not timely.

In addition, the ZCTA isn’t as complete as the USPS zip-code list as it focused on geographical areas and so its coverage of e.g. PO boxes is more limited. However, given the specifications of this dataset this should not be considered a major limitation and so we have not docked points anywhere else.

### More on Zip-Codes and the USPS

The full database of zip codes from the USPS has not yet been found although it looks like products are available for sale, and they are multiple datasets that can help to provide a whole picture.

The ZCTA file produced by the US Census Bureau is useful but is not the full USPS Database of Zip Codes and lookup tables. Instead, this is a census related product produced every 10 years.

 ""You may have noticed that Census Bureau products refer to “ZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs)” and not simply to ZIP Codes™. The reason that we cannot tabulate data for ZIP Codes is that they do not have distinct geographic boundaries. Designed by the U.S. Postal Service for use in mail delivery, ZIP Codes represent carrier routes made up of individual addresses. A true representation of ZIP Codes would separate out individual housing units and releasing data for them would risk disclosing personally identifiable information"". https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=10488

The ZCTAs are not the same as the (regularly updated) USPS postal code lookup files or the postal code database with addresses and Lat Long. Those data are for sale and a number of USPS services are resold.

There is an USPS API for companies to integrate their their systems - https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/address-information-api.htm

However, for this wonderful initiative to be truly productive and without a doubt a pillar in the base data of France, we consider that significant steps must be made in the direction of dissolving this complicated situation.","NEW COMMENT FROM CMFG (ETALAB) :

The national address database (BAN) fulfills the requirements to a larger extent as it gives coordinates for all addresses including their zipcodes. It exists in two versions of the base and the first one is the one that is taken into account in this submission (and not in the previous one). We believe this BAN ODBL version can be accepted as an official source because:
- A link to the ODBL version of the BAN, distributed by OSM France, is provided on an official & governmental website: https://adresse.data.gouv.fr/download/ (second link at the bottom of the page) according to the terms of the official BAN convention signed between IGN, La Poste, Etalab and  OSM France http://openstreetmap.fr/f/Convention%20BAN%2015%20avril%202015%20SCAN%20SIGNE.pdf
- the data have the same source than the second version mentionned in the previous comment and is formated at and by Etalab (Prime Minister office for open data and open gov) 

PREVIOUS COMMENT FROM REGARDS CITOYENS : 

The previously registered ""Base officielle des codes postaux"" by La Poste <https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-officielle-des-codes-postaux/> does not match the new requirements as it only provides openly an association of zipcodes with ciies.
Some cities have multiple zipcodes, so even by associating the data with the opened administrative borders database GEOFLA <http://professionnels.ign.fr/geofla>, we would not be able to get coordinates corresponding to zipcodes.

Although another database could fulfill the requirements to a larger extant : the national address database BAN that gives coordinates for all addresses including their zipcodes. Unfortunately it exists under two different versions:

- one fully opendata provided by OpenStretMap France <http://openstreetmap.fr/ban> which is not accepted as a a relevant source here, so we reviewed the following official on
- one free of charge but under a non OpenDefinition compliant license <http://www.savoirscom1.info/2015/04/ouverture-de-la-base-dadresses-nationale-ban-la-fete-gachee-par-une-licence-piege/> by the national geographic institute IGN and the postal service La Poste <http://adresse.data.gouv.fr/download/> 

The latter dataset named ""Base Adresse Nationale"" requires registration for direct download and is supplied after form registration under a closed license (see http://www.savoirscom1.info/2015/04/ouverture-de-la-base-dadresses-nationale-ban-la-fete-gachee-par-une-licence-piege/ for a complete legal analysis)."

The acts can be only downloaded separately one at the time.

The licensing is a problem, since there is no license provision available. On one hand, texts of legislation are exempted from the copyright protection by law and are therefore free to be used. On the other hand, the administration is not a creator of consolidated versions of acts, which are later published online. New acts are valid only after they are published in the official Collection, which is official and binding only in the printed paper offline form. When an amendment of an act is enacted, it is a new act which only enumerates changes in the older act. The consolidated versions of acts are in the Czech Republic unofficial and created by private companies. As can be seen from the downloadable PDF files, the consolidated versions of acts for this dataset are provided by a company Wolters Kluwer Česká Republika. There probably are some sui generis database rights of Wolters Kluwer Česká Republika. The legal relationship between the administration and Walters Kluwer when it comes to this issue is not described. The current situation is therefore that anyone can access this unofficial online version of legislation, but this data set probably cannot be harvested due to the database rights."

The General Secretariat of the Govt has several texts of existing/promulgated laws (The Constitution, Financial and Budget laws, Labour law, Family law, etc.) and many more of draft bills (""Projets de textes diffusés aux membres du gouvernement"", http://www.sgg.gov.ma/Projetsdetextesl%C3%A9gislatifsetr%C3%A9glementaires.aspx ).

The legislative documents do not seem published on a timely basis: many of the recently adopted laws are not featured on any of these websites. This is for ex. the case for the widely discussed ""rape law"" (the Penal Code provision which used to allow the aggressor to marry the victim in order to avoid jail sentence) which was amended in January 2014 (http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2014/01/22/97001-20140122FILWWW00619-maroc-loi-sur-le-viol-amendee.php)."

Its operation is regulated by the Law on Official Publications and Legal Information. - http://likumi.lv/about.php

 - likumi.lv is for systematized, consolidated laws and other legislative acts (complete texts) while https://www.vestnesis.lv/ publishes official decisions which are incremental (you may have separate publications for the initial law and tens of amendments.  - if there are any inconsistencies between these two sources, what was published in Latvijas Vēstnesis is the official version. That's why the law states that Latvijas Vēstnesis is the official publication and likumi.lv is for ""informative purposes"".

The official publisher Latvijas Vestnesis does not receive budget funding for maintenance of Likumi.lv. It is maintained from the earnings of Latvijas Vestnesis (the costs are covered from the charge for the official publication paid by the information submitter, unless otherwise provided by a law or Cabinet Regulations).

Regarding information reuse Likumi.lv points to the legislation that determines how this information can be reused and sets the fee for reuse (however, it is not clear what is meant by reuse and if, e.g., publishing law excerpts on a website requires paying the fee or not):

Government agencies in each part of the UK also maintain ownership registers for agricultural land for purposes of compliance with the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), an agricultural subsidy scheme for farmers in the European Union. For example, the [Rural Land Register][6] for England is maintained by the Rural Payments Agency. These ownership records are not available for public re-use.

Land Registry has released a spatial dataset called [INSPIRE Index Polygons][7] that contains boundaries for registered freehold land and property in England and Wales. This dataset is available for public re-use but only the IDs attached to the boundaries are licensed as open data. The boundary polygons themselves are subject to additional licensing restrictions because they contain derived data from Ordnance Survey. The boundaries are not cadastral data and the dataset does not contain any ownership information.

The portal aggregates metadata and links to decentralized datasets and services: http://www.portalu.de - however, the cooperation between the federal states and national government has been terminated, PortalU will go offline on December 31, 2014.

Data on air and water pollution can be found at the the German version of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register, http://www.thru.de. It allows searching for a specific site, company or field of industry (http://www.thru.de/search/?no_cache=1) as well as downloading the entire database in bulk (http://www.thru.de/fileadmin/SITE_MASTER/content/Dokumente/Downloads/PRTR-Bundle_Herbst-2014_rev1.zip). Searches can be stored as PDF or Excel files, map features can be obtained via WMS. The database is updated twice per year, every April and October. The database covers 2012 as the most recent year, which is due to the rather complicated European reporting system. The most recent update was in October 2014.

The terms and conditions are a bit unclear, as they mainly refer to general use of the site (http://www.thru.de/nutzungsbedingungen/). The terms also state that any use of the data is okay as long as the source is attributed and content is not altered or manipulated. I would interpret this as: ""You shall not change values in the database, but everything else is alright"", especially because thru.de has an own article on its site claiming they are open data (http://www.thru.de/thrude/auswertung/top-thema/thrude-ist-open-data/)."

The Data Selector http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector allows a custom table to be constructed and either viewed or sent to the requestor as a CSV file. However there is a limit on the extent of the query (one test-drive for the Census gave ""The selection you requested will return 1176 rows of data in 770 columns. This exceeds our limit of 256 columns.""). This meets the Census requirement, apart from bulk download. In addition national estimates of annual *emissions* of 36 air pollutants from 1971-2011 are downloadable in CSV format under the Open Government Licence from http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/data-selector, but again this is in the form of a table-builder and it does not seem possible to download all the data in bulk. Further public environmental data for the UK is maintained by several public bodies (mainly the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, plus Defra and DECC). Broadly speaking, data on major sources of pollutants is readily available via Government websites and public mapping applications.

We tried to find this data many times but it's not centralized and most likely unavailable as unified dataset. Russian government delegates ecological issues and pollution monitoring to regional level of the executive government branch. But regional government rarely publish pollution monitoring information and pollution sources. I know only a few public data sources available like Mosecomonitoring (Moscow ecological survey). But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only ""images"" and ""graphics"". So availability of pollutants data for Russian Federation is about 80% - for ""No"", and only about 20% for ""yes"". The only available sources: - http://dynamic.igce.ru/ (not up to date) - pollution monitoring and radiation monitoring (by Rosatom) - http://www.russianatom.ru/ I suggest this dataset for following review.

it seem the data is existent from-Research Production Association ""Typhoon""Russian Participation in GEOSS

also form the site of The Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe 

he Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring in the Russian Federation (Roshydromet) is responsible for the operation and development of the state system of environmental pollution monitoring, and for maintaining the Uniform State Databank on the State of Natural Environment and its Pollution. Roshydromet operates a system for the prompt identification and investigation of dangerous ecotoxicological consequences of emergencies. A system of global baseline environmental monitoring is maintained in Russia, and six integrated monitoring stations are located in biosphere reserves. Air quality monitoring is undertaken by the Institute for Global Climate and Ecology, which prepares the annual Survey of the Pollution of the Natural Environment in the Russian Federation http://www.igce.comcor.ru; and the Russian Aerospace Agency (Rosaviakosmos), which developed a system for environmental monitoring in space http://www/rosaviakosmos.ru. Air pollution monitoring is carried out in more than 350 Russian cities. It covers all major industrial centres and almost all cities with a population of over 100,000. The system includes 1,200 stations for monitoring air pollution in cities and other settlements. Around 4 million samples are analysed annually for more than 20 air pollutants. According to long-term observations, in more than 75 percent of Russian cities maximum concentrations of air pollutants (dust, CO, NO2, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, phenol) exceed established limits. Thus air quality in most Russian cities does not comply with established sanitary and hygienic norms. - See more at: http://www.greenpackonline.org/english/environmental-components.php?id=01-06-07-04#sthash.2EJ4mckw.dpuf

Air quality measurements are taken by automatic DOAS OPSIS stations ensuring continuous registration of polluting substances.

Update (2015): 

  - Not sure if we should consider this dataset timely or not. Changed the answer to ""unsure"" for now. While the dataset is published regularly and in a timely manner, each location has just one measurement set per month.

  - This dataset has 3 types of measurements out of 5 listed in the census criteria. It does not include measurements for Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and Carbon monoxide (CO).

The previously registered dataset <http://www.stats.environnement.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Eider/series/export/csv.do> from Ministère de l'Environnement only provides yearly aggregates at a national level by regions of the required air pollutants emissions. The dataset stopped in 2009 and no update has been published since. Moreover, whereas the dataset requires regular measures, the data offers historical mean annual data. We think this is sufficiently old and unprecise to not be considered here.

Some cities provide data on the national OpenData platform, for example in Nantes <http://data.nantes.fr/donnees/?keywords=pollution&sort_search=date>, Lyon <http://data.grandlyon.com/search/?Q=pollution> or Saint-Malo <https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/indice-iqa-de-la-qualite-de-l-air/> but it is also updated yearly.

from the news
Amid ongoing concern about air pollution in Qatar, a new environmental report shows harmful airborne particles exceeded recommended levels for 159 days of the year in 2012.
The Environment Statistics Annual Report 2013, recently issued by the Ministry of Development, Planning and Statistics, breaks down Qatar’s air quality levels from 2008 until its latest figures in 2012.
It follows data released by the World Health Organization earlier this year, which suggested Doha’s air is among the most polluted in the world.

Pollution

The WHO’s ambient (outdoor) air pollution in cities database 2014 examined air pollution levels in 1,600 cities in 91 countries.

It measures particulate matter, which are small and large droplets in the air. It concluded that Doha had the 12th highest average levels of small and fine particles, known as PM2.5, which can penetrate the respiratory tract and increase the risk of respiratory infections, lung cancer, heart disease and stroke.

According to the US Environment Protection Agency, these particles – which often cannot be seen with the naked eye – are made up of heavy metals and toxic organic compounds, and originate from vehicle exhaust, smelting plants and the burning of organic materials.

Larger particles – PM10 – are mostly caused by dust and smoke. In this category, Doha ranked just outside the top 30.

Standards

While the ministry’s recent report didn’t benchmark Qatar against other countries, it showed that local air pollution levels frequently exceed the WHO’s recommendations as well as Qatar’s own targets, which are more lax than the international standards.

For example, Qatar’s national air quality standards for PM10 are 150 ug/m3 for 24 hours average concentration and 50 ug/m3 for the annual average concentration.

By comparison, the WHO’s standards for PM10 are 50 ug/m3 for the 24-hour average – one third of Qatar’s target – and 20 ug/m3 for the annual average concentration, which is less than half of the national figure.

The MDPS report uses statistics from the Ministry of Environment, which measures air quality at three monitoring stations in Doha – at Qatar University, Aspire Zone and the Mövenpick Hotel on the Corniche.

Levels highest at QU

All three monitoring stations recorded pollution levels above the recommended national and global levels. However, concentration levels of the larger particulates (PM10) were highest at QU station in the north of Doha. That location also recorded the most days when air quality levels did not meet international standards.

Air Quality study - fig14In 2012, the national quality standards were breached on 159 days, or 44 percent of the year

AIR QUALITY INDEX (ICA)
The results are on the map of the country and in other sections of this website are referred to as Index Air Quality (ICA), which is an indicator of how clean or polluted the air at the site of measurement associated the health effects that people may experience in a few hours or days after breathing that air.
The ICA is calculated according to the established form of calculation for the AQI (Air Quality Index) of the EPA, and while not have a national law governing the matter, it will be based on the standards of air quality provided equally by EPA, considering the following parameters: ozone, particles, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.
The ICA ranges from 0 to 500, where 500 represents the highest level of contamination and therefore the highest risk to health. Generally, a value of 100 corresponds to the Air Quality Limit, so the values ​​less than 100 are considered satisfactory.
When the ICA reaches values ​​above 100, the air quality in the place is considered unhealthy to start for certain sensitive groups of the population, and then for all citizens to the extent that the ICA increases. It is understood as sensitive groups for sick people (especially those with respiratory disease), elderly and children.

Air Pollutant Index of Malaysia
Aggregate data about the emission of air pollutants especially those potentially harmful to human health (althoug
The Malaysian Air Quality Guidelines (MAAGs) which form the basis for calculating the API are presented in Table 1. These guidelines have been derived from available scientific and human health data, and basically represent ""safe levels"" below which no adverse health effects have been observed. The MAAGs are generally comparable to the corresponding air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization and other countries. 

The averaging time, which varies from 1 to 24 hours for the different air pollutants in MAAGs, represents the period of time over which measurements is monitored and reported for the assessment of human health impacts of specific air pollutants. As such, the air pollution indices are normally monitored and reported for the same averaging times as those employed for the air quality standards/guidelines. 

The API values are reported for varying averaging time as follows: 

a) PM10 and SO2 on 24-hour running averages.
b) CO on 8-hour running averages.
c) NO2 and O3 on 1-hour running averages.

The API for PM10 reflects specifically levels of particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micron pollution and it may not be linked directly to visibility factors, as visibility is often determined by results of semi-quantitative observations over relatively shorter time periods. 

The API value reported for a given time period represents the highest API value among all the sub-APIs calculated during that particular time period. The predominant parameter contributing towards a particular API value is normally indicated alongside the API value. This approach is an effort to promote a uniform and comparable API system. Ideally, all sub-API values exceeding the API 100 threshold limit should also be reported in addition to the predominant API value per se. 

To determine the API for a given time period, the sub-index values (sub-API) for all 5 air pollutants included in the API system are first calculated using the above mentioned sub-index functions for the air quality data collected from the Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAQMs). The corresponding air quality data are subjected to the necessary quality control processes and quality assurance procedures, prior to the sub-index calculations.

2.1. OVERVIEW OF AIR POLLUTANTS RELEVANT TO AZERBAIJAN
Monitoring of pollution of ambient air in Azerbaijan is conducted by the Department of National
Environmental Monitoring in accordance with the statute “On the rules of implementation of
state monitoring of the environment and natural resources” prepared by the Ministry of Ecology
and Natural Resources, and approved by the resolution No.90 of the Cabinet of Ministers of the
Republic of Azerbaijan dated 1 July, 2004.
There are 3 categories of observation and control stations in order to determine concentration of
sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, dust, phenol, and other noxious
substances. Observations on the pollution of ambient air are carried out at stationary and
mobile stations. Stationary and mobile stations are supposed to be established by taking into
account the area, landscape, industrial development, mobile pollution sources, and number of
population of each city (settlement) as follows:
 50 000 inhabitants - 1 monitoring station;
 50 000-100 000 inhabitants - 2 monitoring stations;
 200 000-500 000 inhabitants - 2-3 monitoring stations, etc.
Monitoring and observation of pollution of ambient air is regularly conducted at 26 observation
stations located in eight big industrial cities of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Baku, Sumgayit,
Nakhchivan, Ganja, Mingachevir, Shirvan, Lankaran, Sheki),covering basic polluting ingredients
(dust, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide), and specific harmful substances
corresponding to the industrial profile of each city. The number of stations is compliant with the
above-mentioned criteria, except for Baku city, where there are fewer stations than it would be
necessary

It is among the basic missions of the National Agency for Environmental Protection (NAEP) to preserve and improve the quality of our nation's air. In order to accomplish this mission, the Agency must be able to evaluate the status of the atmosphere compared to clean air standards and historical informations. That's why the NAEP established since 1996 an Air Quality Monitoring Network (AQMN) composed by thirteen permanent monitoring stations, two mobiles laboratories and a data elaboration centre with the aim of characterizing human health exposure and public impacts of conventional pollutants. In Tunisia, that extends over 163900 km² and includes 24 metropolitans towns, there are several permanent monitoring stations located in many towns like Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, Gabès Tozeur, Kef. In this paper, some stations of Tunisia and its monitoring networks have been selected as representative sites of the investigated area. In Tunis, the selected monitoring stations were located in Traffic area (Bab Saadoun), in urban area (El Mourouj) and in a suburban area (Nahli). Each station is provided with automatic analyzers of O 3 , NOx, SO 2 , PM10, CO and with meteorological sensors such as temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and direction. Nitrogen oxides, NO and NO 2 , were analysed using the chemiluminescence method. The measurement of ozone is based on the capacity of such gases to absorb ultraviolet rays with opportune wavelengths, generated by built-in lamp. Carbon monoxide CO is analyzed infrared rays absorption (IR). The measurement of PM10 is based on the beta ray attenuation method while SO 2 is analysed using a fluorescence method. For all parameters, the data are collected by the monitoring network every hour. The data were validated according to this protocol: first, a preliminary validation was carried out by the software, which invalidated all the data occurred in calibration hours and the data identified as artifacts then a manual calibration was carried out by the operators, considering the relations among the parameters. This way it is possible to verify that eventual critical data are related to real pollution situations. Moreover, meteorological data (wind speed and direction) were used to investigate about the influence of natural events on high or low concentration situations"

Reports vary in the measurements shown there. Most of the measurements are missing in recent reports, while they existed in last year's reports. Some other measurements are only shown as forecast but not in reports for actual measurements. The data is only shown in charts, which makes it not possible to extract daily measures. Finally, the most recent report was for May 2015, and it is for one station only (Cairo), older reports had measurements for more stations.

Egyptian Meteorological Authority (EMA) has 5 stations to measure the background pollution around Egypt. The stations are Cairo, South Valley, Marsa Matruh, Hurghada, and Farafra. However, as stated above, the recent reports only shows results from Cairo station, while measurements of other stations were only shown in older reports."

its seem that Originally the The criticism is of incorrect information Pollution
What was originally written
There are datasets about level of pollution of settlements, radiation state of surface air, the density of radioactive fallout in the surface layer of the atmosphere, changes of complex index of water pollution in the rivers, reserviours, lakes and canals. The information provided by government officials in Kazakhstan (by default) is open for reuse, publishing as cited by the law.","No data is  available online for air pollution 
but it seem the data is Measured -no pm data Exist so the data
is Considered non-existent 
http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/epr/epr_studies/kazakhstan.pdf

The four basic pollutants (SO2, CO, NO2 and dust)
are monitored, as are some site-specific pollutants
such as heavy metals, HF, HCl, NH3, arsine,
phenol, formaldehyde and chlorine. There are no
ground-level ozone monitoring data available. Data
on lead and other heavy metals as well as
benzo(a)pyrene, which were monitored regularly in
the past, are scarce at present. No information on
PM 10 or PM 2.5 is available. 
Air quality is assessed according to the so-called
IZA5 indexes, which record the exceeding of
maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs) of
five representative pollutants, together with their
toxicity classes. The air is considered polluted, if
this index is higher than 5. As shown in table 4.6,
air quality has improved slightly in recent years,
but still needs to be improved in most cities.
Moreover, due to a lack of money monitoring has
suffered some inconsistency over the past years,
reducing the number of monitoring sites as well as
the number of monitored pollutants. The indexes
are therefore not always calculated from the same
set of pollutants, and this may result in
inconsistency. For example, if in Almaty
benzo(a)pyrene, also in the highest toxicity class,
was included in calculations of the IZA5 index, it
would amount to 54. When benzo(a)pyrene was no
longer measured, the value of the index fell, but
this does not necessarily mean that air quality in
fact improved."

Air Quality Report For EIA of The Cayman Islands Berthing Facility

1.1.2 Baseline Air Quality Environment
The Terms of Reference (ToR) calls for focus on certain pollutants: nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and the finer size fraction of airborne particles (PM10).   The
ToR also calls for quantification of Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHGs) focusing on carbon
dioxide (CO2).  Together, in this assessment, these four substances are termed compounds
of potential concern (COPC).
Air quality monitoring is not routinely undertaken on the Cayman Islands, and no
data is publicly available on existing levels of air pollutants.   Due to the lack of existing
ambient air quality monitoring data available within the study area, a three month survey
for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) was carried out using passive sampling
devices (PSDs) as called for in the ToR.   Use of the small, portable and passive monitors
provided readily deployable methods without requirements for local power, and thus
allowed for flexibility in sampling site selection.    The objective of the air monitoring
program was to determine an initial indication of background (baseline) levels of target
contaminants.

In addition, precinct level data is incomplete and not available upon request. Only district level data is. This makes it difficult to conduct many kinds of analyses on the data.

Previous year's review below:
The Ministry of Interior is responsible for this information and for the collection of this data. It has no website (yet ?). Also, the Ministry of Interior is not a producer of Data at the Open Data portal (www.data.gov.ma). The Ministry of Interior thus collects data but does not share it, neither on the data.gov. ma nor elsewhere.

No data exists online at all. The conditions according to which the data may be released are unknown. It is unknown how the data is handled. Thus, questions about pricing policy and timeliness have been marked 'Unsure' to reflect this reality."

The data on elections is not open to the public under EML standard. If this data is open it would enable new applications and insights that have a positive impact on our democracy. At this moment, very little information is available about the elections: On the website of the Election Council the results appear only five weeks after the elections in its database. In this database, only the results on the municipal level is shown, not at the level of polling stations. Although the unofficial results of the local elections were announced one day after the elections (March 20, 2014), one is referred to the websites of local governments for the results. On March 28, 2014 when the last recounts were done, one is still referred to the websites of local governments. On election night, news is followed by calls that are made by news agencies to municipalities. These are not actual open data of the actual results. A misinterpretation of results or an error in the news chain could cause wrong information being spread.

However, this places restrictions on what data can be obtained, even though the data does exist. More details below:

Because Canada is a federation of provinces and territories, these data would be considered incomplete, as companies are also registered, sometimes exclusively at those jurisdictions. A complete picture would require going to each jurisdiction and assessing their degree of openness. This response is solely for the federal / national level. These data are however generally incomplete, are destroyed every 7 years as per the tax act and are inconsistently managed. They are also not easily available to the public. While these national scale data meet many of the OKFN criteria, the fact that they are incomplete, inaccurate and destroyed every seven years is problematic, especially regarding transparency and investigations into money laundering. Furthermore, they are not readily accessible by the data producer, you can find a company but not a list of all the companies. Also, the Corporations Canada database ""does NOT include corporations created under financial legislation (such as financial institutions, insurance companies or loan and trust companies) or those created under provincial/territorial legislation or corporate legislation from another jurisdiction.""

Actually, this dataset does not include descriptions regarding the different budget sections, but the budget in the dataset is well divided by government departments, ledgers, accounts, sectors, parts, programs, and sub-programs so general citizens can easily understand where the money goes without explicit descriptions.

This makes comparisons of actual spending with the budget , particularly difficult.

The data on the government portal is no sufficient and not updated. Link to the portal -http://www.data.gov.sa/dataset?query=budget&sort_by=changed&sort_order=DESC,"The Ministry of Finance is the body responsible for preparing the budget. It publishes a report for the annual budget that includes general income and expenses for Saudi. However, these reports ( http://www.mof.gov.sa/Arabic/DownloadsCenter/Pages/Budget.aspx ) do not include a government department level breakdown and therefore do not qualify as being available for the purpose of this index. 

The data published by the Ministry of Finance is in the form of textual document (see this years budget here: https://www.mof.gov.sa/Arabic/DownloadsCenter/DocLib/%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86%20%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9%202015%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AE%D8%A9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9.pdf), where numbers are approximate and mentioned in the form of ""about so and so"". The document has section for the total budget, and sections for department, but because the data is not in a table, it is not clear if all departments are mentioned or not, numbers doesn't seem to sum up. As mentioned by the submitted, the data doesn't qualify for the index this year, thus  I'd rather set the data existence question to no.  Furthermore, the Saudi Data Portal (http://www.data.gov.sa/) doesn't seem to have an updated data for the budget. Only budget from 2 years ago (see here: http://www.data.gov.sa/dataset/government-budget-budget-allocations-first-chapter)"
