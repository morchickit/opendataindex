All public and private companies providing personal transport are required to export data to NRI, and they as of 2014-11-19 have 214 companies in their database, according to their API.

Whether data is available in bulk is uncertain. This depends on the definition. I've been strict here, since it was not trivial to download the raw base data for all routes in Norway with the current API-documentation. You can however easily list all transport companies, the routes they provide, search to/from and get trip-results, query for further details on each journey etc.

Note1:  the license is not prominently mentioned on the website. It is mentioned on the form you have to fill out to get an API-key.

Each regional and local governments publish with several issues: 1. Data is not always published online 2. Data is not always up to date 3. Data is not available as open data 4. No open licenses 5. Measurement of openness of transport data is very limited since it's not concentrated anythere. But rail transport schedules and most airports are public so timetables available. Step by step explanation
1. Does the data exist? Yes, national level transport timetables available at http://pass.rzd.ru - it's Russian rail data 2. Is data in digital form?

Looking at rail where there is an interstate system, similar to the UK, Australia has a nationally supported rail system in which the actual service is provided by private operators (but track is publicly owned and maintained). Similar to the UK, there are therefore good public interest grounds for the government to require provision of timetable data. Focusing on rail then there is no consolidated database of timetable information - instead you are directed off to each rail companies website where you must do your own lookup using a classic HTML interface. As such it is clear the data exists and is online but is not machine-readable, not in bulk and based on the notice on various websites not open (for example, Transport West Australia's train website has a classic fully restrictive copyright notice at http://www.transwa.wa.gov.au/Default.aspx?tabid=113)"

Final reviewer: The majority of information is available as PDF embedded in a flash reader. The data overall is available in a non-readable format and is not available in bulk. Yet these criteria were marked as 'unsure' since one can filter and download quite some data through the CensusInfo database, incl. in a machine-readable format. 

Regarding the timeliness of data, it is marked as outdated: 
http://www.censusinfo.capmas.gov.eg/DivInfo/ and http://www.censusinfo.capmas.gov.eg/DivInfo/DIWizard/DIWizardHome.aspx are the CAPMAS database; they seem to provided data from either 1980 or 2012 (unclear).

My name is Lorena Rivero, in charge of the open budget site in Mexico. Going through the index you recently published, I found some information ranked as ""Unsure"", specifically in the part of Government Spending where it says ""I don't find detailed information about the spending on an eg. monthly basis"".

In this matter I would like to show that we have extensive information in a monthly basis, including income, showing the different taxes and oil income; expenditure in administrative, functional and economic classifications; debt; grants; local government transfers among many other information in http://www.transparenciapresupuestaria.gob.mx/ptp/contenidos/?id=5. All data can be consulted and downloaded (in xls) free of charge according to the terms and conditions stated in the site (Términos y Condiciones de uso de la información) allowing the user to create its own time series and receive the data in different ways, for example in millions, accumulative or percentage of the GDP.

Becky Sweger - National priorities project
After a GAO audit (http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-476) of USASpending.gov was published this summer, HHS agreed to start submitting aggregated Medicare spending data. I can confirm that Medicare benefits payments are showing up now (they didn't as of a few months ago), but didn't confirm the data are complete.
If Medicare benefits are now represented in USASpending.gov, it's likely no longer true that the site represents ""only a small part of federal spending data."" I'd re-reword to ""So while the data are available, they represent an incomplete picture of federal spending that does not include government salaries, benefits, and other operating expenditures.""
Agency procedures for reporting money paid to (or on behalf of) individuals are inconsistent. The Social Security Administration has always done a great job of reporting. HHS finally decided to aggregate and report Medicare. USDA, however, doesn't accurately report food stamp benefits in USASpending.gov. Since this type of payment represents the largest chunk of U.S. spending, it's important to have consistent and enforced guidelines for reporting.


2013 comments: The data at USASpending.gov accounts for only a fraction of all government spending, and it is organized in a way that makes it hard to understand and use. So while the data are available, it's only a small part of federal spending data. It does not include expenses on government salaries and operating expenditures or information on Medicare, the nation's government sponsored medical insurance for the elderly (~20% of total spending). There are no government-wide spending records that would actually be more helpful --- that is, the government doesn't collect the type of data about its own spending that would be useful to the open government world. 

The data available at USAspending.gov comes from a variety of sources and is presumably licensed based on the original source licenses: http://usaspending.gov/learn?tab=Sources%20of%20Data"

Open postcode data which meets the specification here (postcodes and corresponding geospatial locations - lat/long or equivalent) is available via the Ordnance Survey's Code-Point Open dataset, which contains the 1.4m GB post codes each with a UK national grid reference of the postcode's location in eastings and northings (convertable to lat/long by published formulae) and with the administrative area (country/county/district/ward, plus National Health Service Region and Authority) in which it is located. This is updated quarterly. Similar Postcode data for the devolved province of Northern Ireland is *not* available as Open Data. The main UK *address* database (~24m individual addresses) is confusing called the Postcode Address File. This is a subscription-only database privately owned by the Royal Mail. The Open Data User Group have been pressing for its release too - see http://data.gov.uk/blog/dont-sell-our-postcodes-odug-on-why-we-should-have-open-addressing-in-the-uk 
The Postcode data as of August 2014 is available here: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/Docs/PostCodes/ONSPD_AUG_2014_csv.zip

The US Census provide zip-code centroids as part of their 2010 Gazetteer located at http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer2010.html in the form of the Zip-Code Tabulation Areas:

http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/Gaz_zcta_national.zip

This data is open data (openly licensed, and machine readable etc).

However, there are some limitations of this data as it is based off the census, the last of which was in 2010. Thus, over time this database gets out of date versus the authoritative  data held by the USPS. Given this, the data is marked as not timely.

In addition, the ZCTA isn’t as complete as the USPS zip-code list as it focused on geographical areas and so its coverage of e.g. PO boxes is more limited. However, given the specifications of this dataset this should not be considered a major limitation and so we have not docked points anywhere else.

### More on Zip-Codes and the USPS

The full database of zip codes from the USPS has not yet been found although it looks like products are available for sale, and they are multiple datasets that can help to provide a whole picture.

The ZCTA file produced by the US Census Bureau is useful but is not the full USPS Database of Zip Codes and lookup tables. Instead, this is a census related product produced every 10 years.

 ""You may have noticed that Census Bureau products refer to “ZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs)” and not simply to ZIP Codes™. The reason that we cannot tabulate data for ZIP Codes is that they do not have distinct geographic boundaries. Designed by the U.S. Postal Service for use in mail delivery, ZIP Codes represent carrier routes made up of individual addresses. A true representation of ZIP Codes would separate out individual housing units and releasing data for them would risk disclosing personally identifiable information"". https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=10488

The ZCTAs are not the same as the (regularly updated) USPS postal code lookup files or the postal code database with addresses and Lat Long. Those data are for sale and a number of USPS services are resold.

There is an USPS API for companies to integrate their their systems - https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/address-information-api.htm
Some date exchange for companies - https://www.usps.com/postalone/program.htm
Segmentation direct mail tools https://www.usps.com/business/pdf/Segmentation_WP.pdf

- no government agency seems to be responsible for gathering this type of data (for instance the Statistical Agency ""Institut Nacional de la Statistique"" doesn't produce this type of data and searching on google for ""institut geographique côte d'ivoire"" shows that such institution existed in the 1980s but today does not have any presence on the internet.

Its operation is regulated by the Law on Official Publications and Legal Information. - http://likumi.lv/about.php

 - likumi.lv is for systematized, consolidated laws and other legislative acts (complete texts) while https://www.vestnesis.lv/ publishes official decisions which are incremental (you may have separate publications for the initial law and tens of amendments.  - if there are any inconsistencies between these two sources, what was published in Latvijas Vēstnesis is the official version. That's why the law states that Latvijas Vēstnesis is the official publication and likumi.lv is for ""informative purposes"".

The official publisher Latvijas Vestnesis does not receive budget funding for maintenance of Likumi.lv. It is maintained from the earnings of Latvijas Vestnesis (the costs are covered from the charge for the official publication paid by the information submitter, unless otherwise provided by a law or Cabinet Regulations).

Regarding information reuse Likumi.lv points to the legislation that determines how this information can be reused and sets the fee for reuse (however, it is not clear what is meant by reuse and if, e.g., publishing law excerpts on a website requires paying the fee or not):

Laws and other legal documents are available via a search interface. The format of the documents is HTML; there is also a PDF download link. Neither of these qualifies as machine-readable because they would need to be scraped in order to extract the text of laws.

An offline version of the data is available for download, but only for paying users; therefore, this does not qualify as making the information available in bulk. Likewise, this downloadable version could potentially be disassembled to extract machine-readable versions of the documents, but this also doesn't qualify as machine-readable.

All government-generated information in Georgia is legally in the public domain, but the Legislative Herald Website specifies ""All Rights Reserved"" which could lead uneducated users to believe that the information was copyrighted. Thus, I marked this dataset as not openly licensed.

The terms also state that any use of the data is okay as long as the source is attributed and content is not altered or manipulated. I would interpret this as: ""You shall not change values in the database, but everything else is alright"", especially because thru.de has an own article on its site claiming they are open data (http://www.thru.de/thrude/auswertung/top-thema/thrude-ist-open-data/)."

The Data Selector http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector allows a custom table to be constructed and either viewed or sent to the requestor as a CSV file. However there is a limit on the extent of the query (one test-drive for the Census gave ""The selection you requested will return 1176 rows of data in 770 columns. This exceeds our limit of 256 columns.""). This meets the Census requirement, apart from bulk download. In addition national estimates of annual *emissions* of 36 air pollutants from 1971-2011 are downloadable in CSV format under the Open Government Licence from http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/data-selector, but again this is in the form of a table-builder and it does not seem possible to download all the data in bulk. Further public environmental data for the UK is maintained by several public bodies (mainly the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, plus Defra and DECC). Broadly speaking, data on major sources of pollutants is readily available via Government websites and public mapping applications.

The data is released as HTML and in PDF files on the agency's website http://nea.gov.ge/en/service/environmental-pollution/7/bulletin, and on http://meteo.gov.ge/radiation. 

The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Protection of Georgia has released aggregate annual data on various pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions on its website (in a section called economic indicators, http://moe.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=242&info_id=2864 ). However, the data is only collected in three cities in Georgia and the most current dataset available in late 2014 is for the year 2012, the data is thus not released in a timely manner. The data is published in one single Excel file containing aggregate annual, which in this case is sufficient to meet the bulk download criteria. Curiously, the data is only available on the English language version of the website, not in local Georgian language.

We tried to find this data many times but it's not centralized and most likely unavailable as unified dataset. Russian government delegates ecological issues and pollution monitoring to regional level of the executive government branch. But regional government rarely publish pollution monitoring information and pollution sources. I know only a few public data sources available like Mosecomonitoring (Moscow ecological survey). But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only ""images"" and ""graphics"". So availability of pollutants data for Russian Federation is about 80% - for ""No"", and only about 20% for ""yes"". The only available sources: - http://dynamic.igce.ru/ (not up to date) - pollution monitoring and radiation monitoring (by Rosatom) - http://www.russianatom.ru/ I suggest this dataset for following review.

http://www.isie.tn/documents/%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AD%20%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AC%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9%20%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84%D9%89%20%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9.pdf

I would thus consider information to be released on a timely basis -- even if the ""data"" is print-out, manually signed and then re-scanned PDF."

The Annual Budget is issued through a Royal Decree, which is exempt from copyright protection and is there available freely to use, reuse, or to distribute. 

Reviewer: I have solely identified outdated data such as the one for 2012 (issued through Sultan Decree number 2013/250, see here: https://www.mof.gov.om/Portals/1/documents/Financial-reports/final-state-account/2012/Min-Decision-250-2013.pdf). I was not able to locate up-to-date budget report for 2014 or 2015. Lastly, if I consider the Ministry of Finances website, it carries a copyright mention at the bottom.
